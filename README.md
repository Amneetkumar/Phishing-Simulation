# Phishing-Simulation
This project uses ZPhisher to simulate a phishing attack targeting an Instagram login page for educational purposes. It demonstrates how phishing attacks work, raising awareness about cybersecurity risks and phishing prevention, with an emphasis on ethical use in controlled environments.
# Phishing Simulation with ZPhisher - Instagram Login Page

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a **phishing simulation** project where I used the **ZPhisher** tool to simulate a phishing attack targeting an Instagram login page. The purpose of this project is to educate and raise awareness about phishing risks and techniques.

**ZPhisher** is a popular tool that automates the creation of phishing pages for various websites, allowing security enthusiasts and professionals to simulate phishing attacks in a controlled and ethical environment.

### üõ† Tools Used:
- **ZPhisher**: A tool to create phishing pages for different services.
- **Ngrok**: For tunneling the phishing page to the internet.
- **PHP**: For running the local web server to serve the phishing page.

4. **Configure Ngrok** (or use a local server):
    - I Have used Local Server for this, you can you use Ngrok as well.
    - Run `local server http 8080` to get a publicly accessible URL for your phishing page.

## Purpose

This project is for **educational purposes only**. By simulating a phishing attack, I aim to understand the methods attackers use and to demonstrate how vulnerable people can be to these types of attacks. The goal is to raise awareness about the importance of cybersecurity and phishing prevention techniques.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING**: This simulation should only be used in a **controlled environment**. Phishing attacks are illegal and unethical when conducted without explicit consent from the victim. Please ensure that all activities are ethical and comply with local laws.

## Conclusion

Phishing attacks remain one of the most common threats to cybersecurity. Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in setting up and understanding phishing simulations, and I hope it can help others raise awareness of such attacks.
